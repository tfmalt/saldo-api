# saldo-api
A simple api backend to do some banking.

This is a simple wrapper for the [sbanken API's](https://github.com/Sbanken/api-examples), 
to be able to expose access to your account details in a safe way, istead of giving a web client direct access for example.

It uses my other repository [node-sbanken](https://github.com/tfmalt/node-sbanken) as an SDK to make the actual API requests.
